We used the FER2013 dataset, courtesy of Kaggle.com:
See:  https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data

These files not included (but need to be in the src directory for the program to run):

  *  fer2013.csv (too large to include - approx. 300 MB)

Files which contain code written by us (Miguel Guarniz and Azmo Rinsler):

  *  demo.py
  *  jupyter_notebook.ipynb
  *  models.py


Files containing FER2013 data after frontalization:

  *  X_test_frontalized.npy
  *  X_train_frontalized.npy
  *  X_val_frontalized.npy


*** The jupyter_notebook file is included as a convenient alternative to demo file
    (both files have the same code, so use the one which suits your environment)

*** Additional output can be found in the output directory of this submission
